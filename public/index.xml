        <description>SPNG devlog http://localhost:1313/spng/posts/reset/ -&lt;p&gt;As the year is coming to an end, I am coming to the realisation that Stream-Pi has been dead for more years than it was alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, I have announced a complete re-write half a dozen times. But every single one of them ended up in a brief period of full time work, followed by an abrupt stop due to exams/personal issues. By the time I am free again, I lose the motivation to work because usually I forget which component or part I was working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a way to keep myself motivated, I start this blog today as a way to share progress regarding the state of SPNG &amp;ldquo;Stream-Pi Next Generation&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, this name is just a placeholder, as I am in search for a nice name for this. It &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be opensourced once ready and named.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;note&#34;&gt;Note&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This and all future posts will be mostly ramblings and un-edited. A lot of these things may (and will) change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;technology&#34;&gt;Technology&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPNG will be follow a Host-Device architecture. The Host will be the main system of the user. Device is the input device. A host may have multiple devices connected to it. Each device can talk to each other via the host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be designed with latency in mind, so that we can also pair QMK/VIA into the same ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary goal is to keep everything as abstracted and modifiable. The only thing I fear for is, too much complexity will drive users away and make it hell to add new features. Technical debt is also real, hence I wish to keep it simple as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the host side, I will primarily use C++ with Qt Quick for the user interface&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have contemplated about Rust, but at the time of writing, I just cannot find myself writing rust code that i will gut out and re-write half a dozen times. I am more of a &amp;ldquo;prototyper&amp;rdquo; than someone who first thinks of an elaborate plan, then slowly implement it. I would still chalk it up to my lack of experience to Rust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I considered Java, Kotlin, Go, but truth be told none of these languages have a proper UI framework for the desktop. Moreover, since I want this to also have as low latency as possible, I wish to avoid using any VM managed system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I do not like C++. That is why I will be writing a document or atleast refer to a styling/coding guide to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Qt Quick is perhaps the most feature rich and easy to use UI framework for the desktop, full stop. There is slint, but it does not support dynamic loading of &lt;code&gt;.slint&lt;/code&gt; files QML does. There is some activity, and IIRC, their Rust version actually has some level of support for that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neither C++/Qt Quick is really ideal, both of them are &amp;ldquo;heavy&amp;rdquo;, full of crust and crumbs, but the sheer amount of resources and ecosystem around them want me to stick more them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Client side is mostly left up to the programmer to implement. I will still be working on &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; android/iOS/etc. implementations. I would use the same Qt/C++ approach there or the native one, whichever seems easy for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the &amp;ldquo;pluginification&amp;rdquo; of the Device - Host connection, we can now have custom clients including ones powered by MCUs. I want to provide first class support for this, so I will be putting huge emphasis on this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;milestone-zero&#34;&gt;Milestone Zero&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create and document the basic structs, classes, the &amp;ldquo;core&amp;rdquo; of the system that can be expanded upon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create very basic UI with theme based on letterboxd&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
