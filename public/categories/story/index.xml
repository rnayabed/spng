      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the year is coming to an end, I am coming to the realisation that Stream-Pi has been dead for more years than it was alive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the past, I have announced a complete re-write half a dozen times. But every single one of them ended up in a brief period of full time work, followed by an abrupt stop due to exams/personal issues. By the time I am free again, I lose the motivation to work because usually I forget which component or part I was working on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
